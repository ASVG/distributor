If you have run the image processing before, make sure the "expression_profiles_combined.xls" excel file is copied to this directory from the image processing directory. If not, a precomputed version of the file is already in this directory. Also, if you wish to run the distribution calculation without having run the image processing step first, cd to the image processing directory (from the base directory), download this the file to the directory: https://www.dropbox.com/s/q63kklobytwfa6r/vectors_collected_manual61.tar?dl=0 Then run "tar -czvf vectors_collected_manual61.tar vectors_collected_manual61" This unpacks precomputed distributions. Run "tar -czvf result_vectors_sagittal_nissl61.tar result_vectors_sagittal_nissl61" to unpac the pre-run Nissl results.

To compute the distributions, run the program "run_all1." This uses as inputs the outputs of the image_processing step. Each of the three steps in "run_all1" can be run separately, provided the preceding ones have been run. The script outputs the figures used in the paper.
